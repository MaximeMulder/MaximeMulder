### Hello

I am Maxime Mulder, a French software engineer and computer scientist graduate. You can find my CV, its custom template, and their source code [here](https://github.com/MaximeMulder/cv).

While I worked on many projects such as low-level entreprise software or full stack web development, I found my passion in the study of programming languages. Therefore, most of my repositories are interpreters I developed throughout the years:
- [Clam](https://github.com/MaximeMulder/clam) is a small statically typed functional language written in OCaml, it incorporates many type features of System $F^ω_{<:}$.
- [Leaf](https://github.com/MaximeMulder/leaf) is the first interpreter I ever wrote, it is a dynamically typed imperative language I wrote in Java as a session project for my winter 2020 compilation course.
- [Lif](https://github.com/MaximeMulder/lif) is essentially an improved version of Leaf. I wrote it in Rust in the end of 2020.
- [Plis](https://github.com/MaximeMulder/plis) is an explicitly parallel instruction set and an associated virtual machine I wrote in Rust as a session project for my winter 2021 virtual machines course.
- The interpreter of my master's thesis is not yet open sourced, it is written in Java for a statically typed object-oriented language and integrates features such as multiple inheritance, generic typing or static evaluation.

You can also find my CV [here](https://github.com/MaximeMulder/cv) (as previously mentionned) and a small website I made for a school project [here](https://github.com/MaximeMulder/greentech-website) (or go [here](https://maximemulder.github.io/greentech-pages/) for the deployed version).

Thank you for reading !
