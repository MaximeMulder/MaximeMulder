### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Maxime Mulder, a French software engineering student currently studying at UQAM in Montreal.

During my scholar and professional cursus, I have worked on diverse projects such as full-stack web developpment or entreperise software programming.

While I liked all these projects, my favourite computer science domain is programming language design, which is why many of my repositories are interpreters :
- [Leaf](https://github.com/MaximeMulder/LeafProject) is the first interpreter I ever wrote, it is a dynamically typed language created for my winter 2020 compilation classes.
- [Lif](https://github.com/MaximeMulder/Lif) is another dynamically typed language and my main personnal project. If I have enough time, I would like to turn it into a statically typed toy programming language in the future.
- Another language is coming soon, it will be statically typed and very cool !

Outside of programming, I like technologyðŸ›° in general, movies ðŸŽ¥, video games ðŸŽ® and other stuff, you can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaximeMulder) if that interests you, although I must warn you I don't tweet very often.

Have fun !
