### Hi there 👋

My name is Maxime Mulder, and I am a french student in its fifth year of IT engineering studies. I am also aiming to get a Canadian IT master degree next year.

I like technology🛰, low and high level programming💻, movies🎥, video games🎮 and stuff.

That's all for now, I know this README is quite currently boring, but I'll be sure to improve it in the future !
