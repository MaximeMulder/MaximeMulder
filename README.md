Hello 👋, I am Maxime Mulder, a french student in its fifth year of IT engineering studies, I am also aiming to get a Canadian IT master degree next year.

I like technology🛰, low and high level programming💻, movies🎥, video games🎮 and stuff.

Well that's all, this README is quite boring right now, but I'll be sure to improve it in the future !
